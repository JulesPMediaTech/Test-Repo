// Hello Gits, this is my first git test
// Paving the way for knowledge and contributions
//
// My first projects will be scripts for mostly application-specific. Here are a few examples:
//    'VMix' - the excellent Streaming and Content software application. Written in a proprietary form of vb.Net
//    'QLab' - versatile cueing app for audio, video, lighting, show data. Written in Applescript
//    'Logic Pro' - Apple's flagship music production package. A small Organisational volume util.
//    configurable BASH shell script built on rsync. Ideal for backing up low-level files to NAS drives
